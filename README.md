# ocaml_knowledge_of_trial_and_error

## Introduction

I've looked at many languages in my carreer as a software engineer and I started
to like and dislike some languages. But I've never really used a ML language
like OCaml, F# or Standard ML in a meaningful project. This is what I want to
change. First I'll check out the [**99 Problems (solved) in
OCaml**](https://v2.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html), then I'll try to
do some kind of terminal application, afterwards I'll have a look at
[**Eliom**](https://ocsigen.org/eliom/latest/manual/overview), a multi platform
application framework and finally I want to create a game engine on top of
[**raylib**](https://www.raylib.com/) but that's in the far future. 

## Progress

- [x] 99 Problems
